tvb-robot in the GetYourBotOn Hackathon (Toronto, Nov 2014) 
===========================================================

Whilst I'd been thinking idly about a *tvb-robot*-type project for a little while, the GetYourBotOn hackathon was what prompted me to think a bit harder about it, and indeed to create this repository.


##About the hackathon
 
The hackathon (website [here](http://www.getyourboton.com/), which I heard about from a blank-forwarded e-mail from someone at the University of Toronto, 

The 'rules' for hackathon entries are: 

> *-the robot must move in some way*
> *- the robot must use a microcontroller*
> *- the robot must be able to sense something in its environment or receive input*
> *- the robot must be demonstrated on the final day of the hackathon*
> *- the robot must in some way relate to the theme of “Brains”*
