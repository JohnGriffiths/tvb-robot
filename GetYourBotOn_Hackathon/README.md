tvb-robot in the GetYourBotOn Hackathon (Toronto, Nov 2014) 
===========================================================

Whilst I'd been thinking idly about a *tvb-robot*-type project for a little while, the GetYourBotOn hackathon was what prompted me to think a bit harder about it, and indeed to create this repository.


##About the hackathon
 
The hackathon [website](http://www.getyourboton.com/), says that it 'will explore *Robots that think for us*,  *Robots that take care of us when we have trouble thinking*, *Robots that leave us free to think*'. 

In the e-mail that I heard about the event from there was also mention of an ageing/healthy brains theme;

>*This year we’ll pay special attention to the types of robots that will help us as we grow old, enable us to live independently, keep us company and help us as our brains fail us. Teams will explore social robotics, consumer robotics and healthcare robotics for challenges such as aging at home and assisting people with dementia.*

Whilst issues such as these are a big part of the scientific research driving the development and usage of the TVB platform, they aren't (yet) immediately relevant to *tvb-robot*. 

In any case these do not appear to be emphasized much on the website. The 'rules' for hackathon entries, according to the website, are: 

> *- the robot must move in some way*  
> *- the robot must use a microcontroller*  
> *- the robot must be able to sense something in its environment or receive input*  
> *- the robot must be demonstrated on the final day of the hackathon*  
> *- the robot must in some way relate to the theme of “Brains”*
